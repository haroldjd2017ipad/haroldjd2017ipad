👋 Hi, my name is Harold and I'm an experienced Roblox scripter that has been scripting for over 2 years. 
I love to script random stuff in Roblox studio and i can make almost anything. I know lua, python, c#, javascript, and c++. 
Lua is the first programming language that i have learned.

👀 I'm interested in programming and making games
💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on a roblox development team and i'm looking for scripter jobs
